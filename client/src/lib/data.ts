My Beloved Mokshita,

Every time I gaze into your eyes, I'm reminded of how deeply God loves me. Looking at you, I know with absolute certainty that God loves me, for He blessed me with someone as extraordinary as you.

From the moment you entered my life, everything changed. Colors became more vibrant, music sounded sweeter, and ordinary moments transformed into treasured memories. You are the miracle I never knew I needed, the answer to prayers I hadn't even whispered yet.

Your smile - oh, that beautiful smile - it lights up even my darkest days like the first rays of dawn breaking through the night. When you laugh, the world seems to pause just to listen. The way your eyes sparkle when you're excited about something makes my heart skip countless beats.

As your birthday approaches on September 8th, I find myself overwhelmed with gratitude that I get to celebrate another year of your existence. You deserve not just a day of celebration, but an eternity of happiness and joy. Every heartbeat of mine is dedicated to making you feel cherished, not just on special occasions, but in all the quiet moments in between.

In your presence, I've discovered the true meaning of love - patient, kind, selfless, and boundless. You make me want to be a better person, not because you demand it, but because you inspire it simply by being who you are.

With you, I've learned that love isn't just a feeling that comes and goes; it's a choice I make every morning when I wake up, and the last thought before I fall asleep. It's in the small gestures, the inside jokes, the comfortable silences, and the way we understand each other without words.

They say that when you find your soulmate, your soul recognizes them instantly. Mine recognized you, and it's been singing your name ever since.

"In a world full of temporary things, you are my permanent address." You're home to me, Mokshita. The place my heart returns to, time and again.

I promise to stand by you through every triumph and trial, to hold your hand through stormy nights and sun-drenched days, to love you completely and unconditionally for all the days of my life.

Thank you for choosing me, for loving me despite my imperfections, and for making every day an adventure worth living.

You are my greatest blessing, my answered prayer, my favorite what-if that actually happened.

With all my heart and soul,
Pratyush
`;
